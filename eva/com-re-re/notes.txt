I'm thinking I should set up a select data routine first. This will analyze the data
and count everything.

what is all the data that I need to select for the pre-deployment?

- Committee reports
  * need to worry about meeting date / whatever else i'm 'saving' a query on 

- CommitteeReportCommitteeActionToAgendaItems
  * these should have all the custom actions and custom agenda items

- CommitteeMeetinAgendaItems where 
CommitteeReportCommitteeActionToAgendaItems.AgendaItemid = CommitteeMeetingAgendaItems.AgendaItemId

- I believe I can just ignore RemovedAgendaItems all together.

- group all CommitteeReportCommitteeActionToAgendaItems by agenda id 
  * ea group wll have a agenda item id and many action ids
  * copy over the sub text

- one difference not accounted for in the document:
    * the custom items previously were tracking both the recommended custom action
    and the reported out custom action, on the CommitteeReportCommitteeActionToAgendaItems table
    in the same row.
    * not the custom actions are tracked the exact same way the legislative item actions
    are tracked, with the CommitteeReportActions table. This allows the user to have as many custom action
    as they want

- NOTE: Might be best to create a CommitteeReportAgendaItem for every CommitteeMeetingAgendaItem
    * for every CommitteeMeetingAgendaItems that have a meeting that has a report.
    * then iterate over all the already created actions. and roll calls. and create the relevant rows
    for those
    * what could go wrong with this approach?
        * how do we know that there is a CommitteeMeetinAgendaItem 
        that is on the report and not on the meeting or vice versa?
        * the committeeReport gets its data from the shared.CommitteeMeetingAgendaItem table
        * the committeeMeeting get its data from the eva.CommitteeMeetingAgendaData table
        * which means that we should be good to get all agenda item data from shared.CommitteeMeetingAgendaItem
        and its safe? to assume that if the data is in the shared.CommitteeMeetingAgendaItem table
        and that id isn't in the removed table then it should be carried over.


- TESTING
    * add agenda items without publishing.
    * add agenda items with publishing
    * have a mix of both
    ** always test Legislative Look Up
    ** always test committee report parameter in daily journal
    ** always test committee roll call parameter in meeting minutes
    * HOW TO THIS THIS THING LOCALLY
    ** go to state with no new migration 
    ** make changes to com re
    ** document changes
    ** run pre script
    ** change to migrated state
    ** run the app click around 
    ** run post script 
    ** compare and review logs
    * Then to go back, 
    ** make sure to revert the migration
    ** then commit
    ** checkout develop
    ** do stuff in eva




** don't forget the roll call parameter strings


NOTE: 
    what i've done so far
    * get all committee reports
    * get all committee meeting agenda items that 
    have meetings that are tied to the reports
    * get all committee report published agenda items
    * get all committee report published actions



EXAMPLE
   - Agenda Items
   agenda_items = [
    {
        "CommitteeMeetingAgendaItemID": 1254,
        "SessionID": 43,
        "CommitteeMeetingID": 789,
        "LegislationID": 567,
        "Description": "Budget Amendment Proposal",
        "SortOrder": 1,
        "IsActive": True,
        "DateAdded": datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 15, 9, 30, 0),
        "LastModified": datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 15, 14, 45, 0),
        "LastModifiedBy": "jsmith",
        "IsPublic": True,
        "IsPublished": False  # This gets added later in the code
    },
    {
        "CommitteeMeetingAgendaItemID": 1255,
        "SessionID": 43,
        "CommitteeMeetingID": 789,
        "LegislationID": 568,
        "Description": "Transportation Bill Review",
        "SortOrder": 2,
        "IsActive": True,
        "DateAdded": datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 15, 9, 35, 0),
        "LastModified": datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 16, 10, 20, 0),
        "LastModifiedBy": "jdoe",
        "IsPublic": True,
        "IsPublished": True  # This gets added later in the code
    }
]

- Committee reports
- Committee report agenda items 
- Committee report actions
- Committee report roll calls

- Committee report attendance ??? not really

- SOMETHING I MIGHRT not HAVE CONSIDERED
  * CommitteeReportPublished 
  * this is somehow in my local
  but in no other environment lol

  * The CommitteeReportActions table has a ActionText column.
  this isn't needed because of the foreign key to the CommitteeReportCommitteeActions table
