Summary:
A reusable Angular header component for the site (header/). Contains a preloader animation, custom mouse cursor elements, back-to-top button, and an off-canvas info panel with logo, contact info, gallery placeholders and social links. The header includes a responsive navigation (mega-menu and submenu entries), a cart dropdown with items, search trigger, and an ORDER NOW CTA. The TypeScript file is an Angular component stub that links the HTML and SCSS. Assets and links are left as placeholders; structure is set up for styling and integration.

Notes:
- Static HTML structure with placeholder assets and links
- Responsive menu and mega-menu markup present
- Offcanvas panel includes gallery and contact placeholders
- Cart and dropdown markup included
- Angular component is a minimal shell (no logic yet)
