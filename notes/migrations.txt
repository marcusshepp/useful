edit this script to add the option to list out migratinos with the arguement 

--list

it'll be used like

python migrations.py --list

this will by default list out the latest 5 migrations
this will exclude the file containing the string 'Snapshot' in the name
this will exclude any files that have the extension .Designer.cs

only print out the file name and the date and time in which it was last edited

sample output:

Last 5 migrations:
01-01-2025 12:00:00 - 20190101120001_CreateTable
01-01-2025 12:00:00 - 20190101120002_CreateTable
01-01-2025 12:00:00 - 20190101120003_CreateTable
01-01-2025 12:00:00 - 20190101120004_CreateTable
01-01-2025 12:00:00 - 20190101120005_CreateTable

the way this fits into the main workflow is
when the user runs the update command, the script will list out the last 5 migrations
before it shows the migration that it grabs to assume the user wants to update to

also print out the migratations at the very end of the script after the workflow
has been completed
but give a message that lets the user know what they are looking at

also allow the user to specify the number of migrations to list out
by default it should be 5

running with a number of 3 should look like this
python migrations.py --list 3

then update the doc string at the top of the script to include this functionality

give me the entire script back in its entirety with the changes made
dont try to save tokens because I will have to rerun the prompt if you do

┏[MShepherd]--[list-migrations ≢ ● ]

┖[~\p\useful]

above is my output from running python migrations.py --list 6

its great BUT i need a few more changes

please output the entire script after otherwise i;ll have to reprompt and spend more tokens

make the output more readable throughout the entire script

I don't want to see the logging info, i just want to see the message that the log is displaying there's no need to see the date and time that log happened for any logs in any part of the command

I also dont want to see repeated information

make the output much more minimal

also, when listing out the migrations they are in the wrong order, reverse them such that the are in the opposite order they are displayed in now.
