I am trying to reach out the owners of a dated website.

I want to sound very professional, honest and down to earth.

Below is my rough draft with a few key points.

I need you to revise what I wrote and make it sound more professional and appealing.

I need you to not souond like a robot and make it sound like a real person wrote it.

I need you to make it sound like you are a web developer and you are offering to help them with their website.

I need you to make sure you are not making any promises that you can't keep.

This will be emailed to the owners of the website.

Give some personal touch to the email. Keep it professional and friendly.

below this line is the rough draft that I wrote.



To the owners of firehouseguitars.com

My name is Marcus Shepherd. I've been a web developer for over a decade. I'm getting my feet wet in 
the world of freelance. My good friend Jake Warsham reached out to you guys and asked if you needed
help with a website redesign. 

Looking at your current website, I see a lot of potential for improvement. The website just looks like it was built a while ago and needs
some attention.

I'm offering a full redesign of your website that would include a modern look and feel, a responsive design, and a more user-friendly experience.
I would also host the website for you and provide ongoing maintenance and support. We can provide you with a way to easily update the
website yourself, through a content management system that is very user-friendly.

A few key points I'd like to address in the redesign:
- The header should be slimmed down as to take up less space on the page and less attention from the user.
- The navigation should be more user-friendly and intuitive.
- The website should be responsive and look great on all devices.
- The website should be optimized for search engines. We do this by making sure the website is fast, secure, and has the right keywords in the right places.
- The website should be easy to update. We can provide you with a content management system that is very user-friendly.
This would allow you to update your music lessions, event scheduling, used inventory listings, phone numbers, photos, staffing and anything else
I might be missing.
- I'd like to see the about us contain a google maps embedded location of the store. 
- I'd like a too a very modern and eye catching landing page that will draw the user in and make them want to explore the rest of the site.

I'd like to offer you a free consultation to discuss your needs and how I can help.

Here is a link to my most recent public project: https://main.d1lut04stchscl.amplifyapp.com/
The domain is not yet connected to the site, but you can view the site at the link above.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Firehouse Guitars Team,

My name is Marcus Shepherd, and I’m a web developer with over a decade of experience. Recently, I’ve been exploring freelance work, and I wanted to reach out after my good friend, Jake Worsham, mentioned you might be interested in updating your website.

I had a chance to look at your site, and I can see the passion and dedication behind your business. However, it’s clear that the website could use some modern touches to better reflect the energy and expertise of Firehouse Guitars. I’d love the opportunity to collaborate with you on a redesign that enhances its usability and visual appeal.

Here’s what I’d propose for the redesign:



    - A modern and visually engaging design to draw visitors in and showcase your brand.
    - Responsive functionality, ensuring your site looks and works great on phones, tablets, and desktops.
    - Streamlined navigation to make it easier for customers to explore your offerings.
    - Search engine optimization (SEO) to improve your online visibility by focusing on speed, security, and keyword placement.
    - A user-friendly content management system (CMS) so you can easily update key sections like lessons, events, inventory, photos, and staff details.
    - Embedded Google Maps integration in the About Us section to make finding your store simple.

A good friend of mine is a photographer and recently did great work for one of Jakes projects. I am imagining the landing page containing a beautiful picture of the store or someone playing a guitar in the store taken by him. Could also be a 5-10 second video as well.

I’d also love to collaborate on a stunning landing page that leaves a lasting first impression, making visitors eager to explore everything you offer.

If this sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d be happy to set up a free consultation to discuss your needs and how we might bring this vision to life.

To give you an idea of my work, here’s a link to a recent project I completed:

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon. Whether or not we work together, I wish you continued success in growing Firehouse Guitars.

Warm regards,
Marcus Shepherd
Web Developer
