I need to create a TUI application

it's going to be written in go lang 
it will utilize bubbletea and bubbles libraries

when activated, it will show a list of projects to choose from 

the way that the projects are kwown is that the application can also be used as a cli tool

so for example as a user
i can cd into the directory i want to add as a project.
and then run the command `home-screen add` and it will add the current directory as a project

the home screen will allow vim keybindings to navigate the list of projects

pressing enter will open the project in neovim
