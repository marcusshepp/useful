- adding actions isn't sticking neither is roll calls
- agenda item actions component is doing too much. its gotta be simplified and needs to be using the state service more. 
is agenda item updated event being used? seems like change occured is the one being used
agenda item component has some type of processing event algorithm going on 
debating if it would just be worth it to create a get request for getting the agenda item actions, or maybe just return the actions 
and the roll call from the update end point. 
could seperate out the roll call and actions updating endpoints. then have each of them return a list of actions 
would this simplify things though
I know at the very least I need to audit and probably remove the process events algo. the code is making the update and also holding state in memory
which is complicating it quite a bit



is published is somehow gone from meeting list

when no actions are selected give some indication when the agenda item is collapsed
